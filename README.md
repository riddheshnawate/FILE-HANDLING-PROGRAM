## TASK DESCRIPTION

The objective of this task was to create and implement a C program that demonstrates various file operations including file creation, writing data, reading data, and appending new data to an existing file. This task was undertaken to understand the importance of file handling in C programming and how files are used for permanent data storage.

In C programming, files are used to store data permanently so that it can be accessed even after the program execution is completed. Unlike variables that store data temporarily in memory, files allow programs to save and retrieve information as required. Keeping this concept in mind, the task focused on using standard file handling functions such as `fopen()`, `fprintf()`, `fgetc()`, and `fclose()` to perform different file operations.

The program begins by creating a file using the write mode. If the specified file does not exist, it is automatically created. After creating the file, data is written into it using appropriate output functions. This step demonstrates how textual information can be stored inside a file through a C program. Error handling techniques are used to ensure that the file is opened successfully before performing any operation.

After writing data to the file, the program performs the append operation. Appending allows additional data to be added at the end of the existing file without removing the previously stored content. This operation is particularly useful in applications such as maintaining logs, updating records, and storing continuous data entries.

The reading operation is then performed by opening the file in read mode. The contents of the file are read character by character and displayed on the screen. This operation helps in understanding how stored data can be retrieved and verified. It also demonstrates how file pointers move through the file during the reading process.

Proper file closing using the `fclose()` function is ensured after each operation. Closing a file is important to save data correctly and release system resources. The program follows a simple and modular structure, making it easy to understand, modify, and reuse for other applications.

This task provided valuable hands-on experience in file handling using C programming. It enhanced the understanding of permanent data storage, file access modes, and safe programming practices. The program successfully demonstrates various file operations and serves as a foundation for advanced applications such as database systems, file management utilities, and record processing systems.
